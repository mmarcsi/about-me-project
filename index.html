        <p> I'm a former teacher, present officer working with healthcare professionals in the public sector.</p>
        <p> I am a hopeless series-junky, an obsessed nature lover and a semi-talented amateur photographer.
        I'm always looking for possibilities to gratify my creativity. Frontend development seems to be a 
        good opportunity for this as well as a new and exciting carrier path.</p>
